`context` is live and `thread` is the corpus; both label which they are. Read
`context` before deciding — a message's meaning comes from the lines before it,
and the corpus is only as current as the last pull.

Every subcommand prints JSON. `send` enforces the autonomy scope, records to the
agent-sent ledger, and logs the outcome.
