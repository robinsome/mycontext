"""Lifecycle glue for litellm's background logging worker.

litellm lazily spawns a ``LoggingWorker`` task on whatever event loop is
current when a completion is logged. Short-lived loops (``asyncio.run`` in
the batch pipeline) then close with that task still pending, and loop
switches drop the task reference without cancelling it — both surface as
``ERROR Task was destroyed but it is pending!`` noise even though nothing
failed. Stopping the worker on the loop that owns it, before the loop
closes or another loop takes over, keeps batch runs quiet while leaving a
long-running server loop free to keep the worker.
