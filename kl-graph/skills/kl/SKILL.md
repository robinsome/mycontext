# Knowledge Graph Query (kl)

CLI tool for querying a spatio-temporal knowledge graph built from DingTalk workplace messages and other exported sources. It contains entities and facts, plus optional experimental multi-resolution communities. Discover capabilities before checking status or querying.

**Architecture**: kl CLI is a thin HTTP client talking to kl-server (port 8200). The server keeps Qdrant + SQLite warm in memory. All commands require the server to be running.

## Mandatory capability discovery

**Before running `status` or choosing any query command, call:**

```bash
kl capabilities --json
```

On Windows use the invocation form documented below, but keep
`capabilities --json` as the first CLI arguments. Parse `commands` and use only
entries whose `enabled` value is `true`; never infer availability from this
static skill text. In particular, `global-search`, `community`, `members`, and
the `communities` search collection are experimental and normally disabled.
`ask` is always available and is the primary retrieval command. If discovery
fails because the server is not running, start the server, then retry
capability discovery before querying.

## Invoking `kl` (any directory, macOS & Windows)

The examples below write `kl ...` / `./kl ...` for brevity, but the repo can be
installed **anywhere**, so never hardcode a path. **Discover the repo root at
runtime, then invoke `kl` relative to it.**

Discover the repo root (call it `KL_REPO`):

- This skill file lives at `<repo>/skills/kl/SKILL.md`, so the repo root
  is **three directories up from this file** — if you know this file's path, use
  its `../../..`.
- Otherwise walk up from the current directory until you find the marker files
  (the `kl` script + `kl_cli.py`):
  ```bash
  # macOS / Linux
  KL_REPO="$PWD"
  while [ "$KL_REPO" != "/" ] && [ ! -f "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" ]; do
    KL_REPO="$(dirname "$KL_REPO")"
  done
  ```
  ```powershell
  # Windows (PowerShell)
  $KL_REPO = (Get-Location).Path
  while ($KL_REPO -and -not (Test-Path (Join-Path $KL_REPO 'kl_cli.py'))) {
    $KL_REPO = Split-Path $KL_REPO -Parent
  }
  ```

Then invoke it (works from any directory):

- **macOS / Linux** — the `kl` wrapper `cd`s into its own directory, so calling
  it via `$KL_REPO` works from anywhere:
  ```bash
  "$KL_REPO/kl" status
  "$KL_REPO/kl" ask "..."
  ```
  Equivalent direct form: `"$KL_REPO/.venv/bin/python" "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" status`.
- **Portable rule of thumb:** if `./kl` fails (wrong directory, or Windows),
  fall back to invoking the venv interpreter on `kl_cli.py` with the same
  arguments — the venv Python is at `.venv/bin/python` on macOS/Linux and
  `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows. On Windows, see the dedicated
  section below for bash-specific syntax and encoding requirements.

## Invoking on Windows (read this if you are on win32)

**AIAssist agents run in bash on Windows, not PowerShell.** The macOS/Linux
examples above (`$KL_REPO/kl`) and old PowerShell snippets (`&
"$KL_REPO\.venv\..."`) **neither works in the agent's bash shell**. Use the
patterns below instead.

### 1. Always set PYTHONUTF8=1

Windows defaults to GBK / cp1252 for console encoding. Without `PYTHONUTF8=1`,
any `print()` or log line containing Chinese characters (group names, entity
names, fact text) will crash with `UnicodeEncodeError` or produce garbled
output you cannot read. Set it as the **first thing** before any `kl` command:

```bash
export PYTHONUTF8=1
```

Or prefix every invocation inline:

```bash
PYTHONUTF8=1 "$KL_REPO/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" status
```

### 2. Use bash syntax: forward slashes, not backslashes

The venv Python lives at `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (note: `Scripts`, not
`bin`). In bash, use **forward slashes** throughout — backslashes are escape
characters in bash, so `"$KL_REPO\.venv\Scripts\..."` will break.

```bash
# Discover the repo root (agent runs in bash, not PowerShell)
KL_REPO="$PWD"
while [ "$KL_REPO" != "/" ] && [ ! -f "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" ]; do
  KL_REPO="$(dirname "$KL_REPO")"
done

# All subsequent calls use forward slashes
PYTHONUTF8=1 "$KL_REPO/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" status
PYTHONUTF8=1 "$KL_REPO/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" ask "你的问题" --pretty
```

### 3. Environment variables: use `export`, not `set`

The `.env` file in the repo uses Windows CMD `set` syntax, which bash cannot
`source`. Instead, export each variable explicitly in bash before starting
the server or querying:

```bash
export PYTHONUTF8=1
export KL_DATA_DIR="$KL_REPO/data"
export KL_DWS_EXPORT_DIR="$KL_REPO/dataset/<your-export-dir>"
export KL_EMBED_BASE_URL=<your-embed-endpoint>/v1
export KL_EMBED_MODEL=Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
export KL_EMBED_API_KEY=<your-key>
export KL_EMBEDDING_DIM=1024
export KL_EMBED_SEND_DIMENSIONS=0
export KL_LLM_BASE_URL=<your-llm-endpoint>
export KL_LLM_MODEL=qwen3.6-flash
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-token>
export DISABLE_AIOHTTP_TRANSPORT=True
export KL_SERVER_PORT=8200
```

### 4. Start the server in bash (not via `./kl`)

The `./kl` wrapper script may not work on Windows. Start the server directly.
**Prerequisite:** all environment variables from section 3 must be exported
in the same shell session first — the server needs `KL_EMBED_*`, `KL_LLM_*`,
etc. to function:

```bash
# (env vars from section 3 must already be exported in this shell)

PYTHONUTF8=1 "$KL_REPO/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" "$KL_REPO/kl_server.py" &
sleep 15  # Qdrant warmup
PYTHONUTF8=1 "$KL_REPO/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" status
```

### 5. Quick reference: the complete pattern

```bash
# One-time per session: discover repo + set encoding
export PYTHONUTF8=1
KL_REPO="$PWD"
while [ "$KL_REPO" != "/" ] && [ ! -f "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" ]; do
  KL_REPO="$(dirname "$KL_REPO")"
done
export KL_REPO

# Environment variables (adjust paths/values for your setup)
export KL_DATA_DIR="$KL_REPO/data"
export KL_DWS_EXPORT_DIR="$KL_REPO/dataset/<your-export-dir>"
export KL_EMBED_BASE_URL=<your-embed-endpoint>/v1
export KL_EMBED_MODEL=Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
export KL_EMBED_API_KEY=<your-key>
export KL_EMBEDDING_DIM=1024
export KL_EMBED_SEND_DIMENSIONS=0
export KL_LLM_BASE_URL=<your-llm-endpoint>
export KL_LLM_MODEL=qwen3.6-flash
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-token>
export DISABLE_AIOHTTP_TRANSPORT=True
export KL_SERVER_PORT=8200

# Start server (if not already running)
PYTHONUTF8=1 "$KL_REPO/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" "$KL_REPO/kl_server.py" &
sleep 15

# Query
PYTHONUTF8=1 "$KL_REPO/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" status
PYTHONUTF8=1 "$KL_REPO/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" "$KL_REPO/kl_cli.py" ask "session打标进度" --pretty
```

### 6. Request timeout

The CLI HTTP timeout defaults to **120 seconds** (configurable via
`KL_CLI_TIMEOUT`). If `kl ask` times out, it usually means Phase-2 LLM
synthesis is slow — the server may still complete the request; check
`kl status` for server health. To allow more time:

```bash
export KL_CLI_TIMEOUT=180  # 3 minutes
```

## End to End (build → ingest → query)

First-time setup from a raw DWS export to answering questions. Steps 1–4 are
the one-time **build**; after that you only use step 5 (query), and re-run the
ingest when new data arrives.

```bash
# 1. BUILD: install deps + point at your endpoints and data (env-only, no
#    secrets are baked into the repo). Put the config in a local .env file
#    (gitignored) and source it before starting the server:
pip install -r requirements.txt
set -a; source .env; set +a          # load KL_* + ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN
```

The repo ships a `.env` at the project root (gitignored — never commit it)
with working endpoints. Nothing auto-loads it, so you must `source` it as above.
It sets:

```bash
# data + export
export KL_DATA_DIR=./data                      # where knowledge.db + qdrant land
export KL_DWS_EXPORT_DIR=/path/to/dws_export   # the exported source folders

# embedding: PAI-EAS Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B (1024-dim). URL MUST end in /v1;
# KL_EMBEDDING_DIM MUST match the model (1024) — it is baked into the Qdrant
# collections, so changing models later requires wiping + re-embedding.
export KL_EMBED_BASE_URL=<your-embed-endpoint>/v1
export KL_EMBED_MODEL=Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
export KL_EMBED_API_KEY=<embedding-api-key>   # real value lives only in .env
export KL_EMBEDDING_DIM=1024
export KL_EMBED_SEND_DIMENSIONS=0

# extraction/synthesis LLM: qwen3.6-flash (Anthropic-compatible base;
# do NOT append /v1 — HTTP client adds /v1/messages itself).
export KL_LLM_BASE_URL=https://example.com/apps/anthropic
export KL_LLM_MODEL=qwen3.6-flash
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<api-key>   # real value lives only in .env
```

```bash
# 2. SERVE: start the retrieval server first (ingest runs inside it).
./kl start
kl status                                      # wait for "status": "ready"

# 3. INGEST: drive the whole build through the running server. This runs
#    Phase A (chunk+embed every source) → Phase B (LLM extract + build+embed
#    the graph) → the improve step (ENTITY_SIMILAR/FACT_SIMILAR edges +
#    communities L0–L3), then hot-swaps the new graph in. Non-blocking.
kl ingest -d "$KL_DWS_EXPORT_DIR"              # omit -d to use $KL_DWS_EXPORT_DIR
kl status                                      # poll: "Ingest: running NN% (phase)"

# 4. COMMUNITY SUMMARIES (optional but recommended): kl ingest builds the
#    community structure but NOT their summaries/vectors. These two steps add
#    1–2 sentence summaries and make `search -c communities` work.
python -m kl_graph.periodic.community_summarizer   # 1–2 sentence summary/community
python scripts/embed_communities.py                # embed summaries (search -c communities)

# 5. QUERY: ask questions (see Retrieval Patterns below).
kl ask "who decided to use e2b for sandbox" -k 5
kl context <fact_id>                               # ground the answer in source
```

Notes:

- `kl ingest` **upserts** into the current DB (deterministic UUID5 ids mean
  re-ingesting never duplicates entities/facts); it has no wipe flag, so for a
  truly clean rebuild `rm -rf "$KL_DATA_DIR"` before step 2. `--no-improve`
  skips the community/PageRank step; `-c N` raises extraction concurrency.
- For a **cold/scripted build without a running server**, the offline
  equivalents are `python -m scripts.ingest --fresh-db` (Phase A + B, `--fresh-db`
  wipes `knowledge.db` — which now holds the extraction cache, so the cache is
  cleared too) followed by
  `python -m scripts.improve --skip-llm-judge`. `kl ingest` is the preferred
  path when the server is up.
- Community columns (`community_L0..L3`) come from the improve step; without it
  `community`/`members` are empty and `entity` shows no community labels.

kl global-search "<question>" [--user "<name>"] [--json]  # experimental; use only when capability says enabled
kl hop -n <node_id> -c '<cursor_json>'   # expand one node one hop deeper (no LLM/embed)
```

**Ingest is two phases** (`kl ingest` for in-server background ingest, or
`python -m scripts.ingest` for a cold/scripted build):
**Phase A** loads + chunks + embeds *every* source folder (chat + wiki/mail/
work/…) into SQLite `chunks` + Qdrant — no LLM, dense/BM25 recall works after
this. **Phase B** runs LLM entity/fact extraction over all chunks, then builds
and embeds the graph (the only LLM-billed phase; results are cached per chunk).
Watch progress with `kl status` (`Ingest: running NN% (phase)`).

> **Run the full ingest (Phase A + Phase B) — `kl ingest` does both.** But you
> don't have to *wait* for Phase B: the service is usable as soon as **Phase A**
> completes (search/ask work off dense + BM25 recall), so start querying while
> Phase B is still running. **Phase B then improves performance/accuracy** by
> adding the entity/fact graph on top — check `kl status` to see when it lands.

Offline build (needs `KL_DWS_EXPORT_DIR`, `KL_DATA_DIR`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`,
`KL_EMBED_API_KEY` in the env):

```bash
python -m scripts.ingest --fresh-db                # Phase A + Phase B (fresh)
python -m scripts.improve --skip-llm-judge         # ENTITY_SIMILAR/FACT_SIMILAR + communities L0–L3
python -m kl_graph.periodic.community_summarizer   # 1–2 sentence summary/community
python scripts/embed_communities.py                # embed summaries (search -c communities)
```

- With no flag, `scripts.ingest` runs the full pipeline with **smart resume**:
  if Phase A is fully done (every chunk persisted *and* embedded) it skips to
  Phase B, else it re-runs Phase A. `--phase-a` = chunk+embed only (no LLM).
- `--fresh-db` wipes `knowledge.db` + the Qdrant dir. The extraction cache now
  lives in the `extraction_cache` table **inside** `knowledge.db`, so `--fresh-db`
  clears it too. To rebuild the graph **without** re-billing the LLM (reusing the
  cache), run `python -m scripts.ingest --build-only` **without** `--fresh-db`.
  To wipe everything, `rm -rf "$KL_DATA_DIR"` first.
- Ids are deterministic UUID5s of normalized content, so re-ingesting never
  duplicates entities/facts.
- Community columns (`community_L0..L3`) are created **only** by
  `scripts.improve` (or `kl ingest` unless `--no-improve`); without them
  `community`/`members` are empty and `entity` shows no community labels.

To ingest a new export into the **running server** (non-blocking — it keeps
serving and hot-swaps the new graph in when done):

```bash
kl ingest -d /path/to/dws_export     # start Phase A → B in the background
kl status                            # poll: "Ingest: running NN% (phase_a|phase_b)"
# -c N raises LLM extraction concurrency (default 8); --no-improve skips
# community detection/PageRank; omit -d to use $KL_DWS_EXPORT_DIR.
```

`search` returns raw nearest-neighbor hits from a single collection (default
`facts`; other collections: `chunks`/`messages`, `entities`, `communities` —
`chunks` is the unified retrieval-unit collection for all embedded source
content, and `messages` is a backward-compat alias for it). `ask` runs the full
engine over chunks+facts (dense+sparse+RRF) **and** walks the depth-1 graph from
the entities/facts the query extracted. Agent callers must derive the retrieval
intent themselves and pass repeatable `--entity`, `--entity-type`, and
`--fact-type` flags using the values advertised by `capabilities`; this skips
the server-side rewrite LLM while retaining server-side entity resolution.
Also pass `--no-phase2` and synthesize from the returned evidence. Plain clients
may omit intent and let the server rewrite, or request a synthesized `answer`
with `--phase2`. Output is JSON by default; add `--pretty` for a human view, or
`--json` to force JSON explicitly. (The browsing commands like `entity` /
`community` also support `--json`.)

### `ask` returns retrieval + a hoppable subgraph

A single `kl ask "<query>"` call returns both flat recall and an interactive
graph view:

- `items`: the embedding-recalled items (dense+sparse+RRF fused facts+chunks),
  cut at `top_k`. This is the flat vector recall.
- `answer`: LLM synthesis, or `null` when `--no-phase2` is set.
- `seeds`: entry nodes as `{id, label}` (`ent:<uuid>`/`fact:<uuid>` + name/text).
- `nodes`: seeds (hop 0) **plus** the hop-1 frontier reached from them, each
  resolved to `{id, type, score, hop, name|text, ...}`.
- `edges`: `{from, to, from_label, to_label, type, weight}` — the walkable edges
  (`ABOUT`/`INVOLVES`); `*_label` inline the endpoint name/text so an edge is
  self-describing. `from`/`to` are node ids in `nodes`.
- `expandable`: `{id, label}` for nodes that still have further un-walked edges.
- `cursor`: opaque walk state — pass it to `kl hop` to expand a node one more
  hop (no LLM, no embed).

When the graph is not built the walk fields come back empty
(`mode="chunks_only"`) and only `items` are populated.

To go deeper, feed an `expandable` id + the `cursor` to `kl hop` (pass the
`.id` from an `expandable`/`seeds` entry):

```bash
kl hop -n <expandable_id> -c '<cursor json from ask>' --pretty
```

`hop` returns **only the newly revealed frontier** (`nodes`/`edges`) plus an
updated `cursor` — the server is stateless between hops, so merge the frontier
into the graph you already hold and chain `hop` again with the new cursor. It
never re-embeds or calls the LLM.

Note the decay: each hop multiplies a node's score by `λ` (default 0.6) and
drops branches below `mini_threshold` (0.2). With these defaults real query
seeds (~0.5–0.6) reach **depth 2** and a strong seed reaches depth 3 — a node
survives while `score × 0.6^hop ≥ 0.2`. Weak/deep nodes eventually return an
empty hop; that is the expected stop signal, not an error.

`graph` / `hop` are the interactive GraphRAG mode — see "Interactive Graph Walk"
below. The embedding server (`kl start embedding`) is only needed on a GPU host;
retrieval itself uses the remote embedding endpoint, so `kl start` alone is
enough for querying.

## Command Best Practices

How to use `kl` well, in priority order:

1. **Discover capabilities first.** Run `kl capabilities --json` and use only
   commands whose live `enabled` value is true. Then run `kl status` to inspect
   health and ingestion progress. If the server is unavailable, start it and
   retry capabilities before selecting a query command.
2. **Plan before you query.** Think about what the user is really asking and
   which commands answer it; don't fire commands blindly (see the Query
   strategy callout under Retrieval Patterns).
3. **Start with `kl ask`, avoid `kl search`.** `kl ask` is the primary entry
   point (hybrid retrieval + graph walk); reserve `kl search` for narrow
   single-collection lookups `kl ask` can't serve. For **conceptual,
   person-scoped "what has X been about / what are my recent tasks" questions**
   that need aggregation rather than a single hit, use `kl global-search` only
   when the live capabilities report it enabled (see Retrieval Pattern 8).
4. **Trace before you trust.** Ground every claim in source: take a `fact_id`
   from `ask`/`entity`/`facts`/`timeline` and run `kl context <fact_id>` to see
   the original message before reporting it.
5. **Discriminate semantic relevance before drilling.** `kl ask` and `kl search`
   return nearest-neighbour hits by embedding similarity — this surfaces
   keyword-overlap results that may be **semantically unrelated** to your
   actual question (e.g. a query about "session 打标障碍" may return results
   about model evaluation timeouts or billing identification simply because
   they share the words "session", "超时", or "标识"). Before running
   `kl context`, hopping the graph, or synthesizing an answer, **pause and
   ask: does this result actually address the user's question, or does it just
   share vocabulary?** Filter out the irrelevant hits, note which results
   genuinely match, and **do not follow irrelevant paths** into `context` or
   `hop` — that wastes the query budget and pollutes the answer with
   off-topic evidence. When in doubt, rephrase the query with more specific
   terms rather than stacking broad keywords.
6. **Chain by id, not by name.** Every id `kl` prints is traceable
   (`entity` → `entity_id` → `kl facts` → `fact_id` → `kl context`). Prefer ids
   when chaining — names aren't unique (e.g. two `周强` entities), so a
   name-based `timeline`/`entity` may mix them up.
7. **Show evidence, then conclude.** Quote the raw `kl` output first, then give
   your synthesis (see the Answering callout under Retrieval Patterns).
8. **Respect the budget.** Cap at ~10 commands per question; stop once you have
   ≥3 grounded facts or two consecutive queries add nothing new (see Search
   Budget & Stop Criteria).
9. **Use `--json` for chaining, `--pretty` for humans.** Query commands emit
   JSON by default (easy to parse ids out of); pass `--pretty` when showing a
   person a result. `--json` always wins if both are given.
10. **Widen before narrowing on empty results.** If `kl ask` comes back thin,
    try a broader phrasing or `kl community` to find the right neighborhood,
    then drill via `kl members` → `kl context`.

## Latency Profile

| Command type | Typical latency |
|---|---|
| entity, expand, context, community, members | 30-50ms server-side |
| timeline (with date filter or low-degree) | 30-50ms |
| timeline (high-degree, no filter) | auto-filtered to 90 days |
| search (single-collection ANN) | remote embed + Qdrant ANN |
| ask (hybrid; may synthesize) | dense+sparse+RRF + hop-1 graph walk; +LLM when it escalates to Phase 2 |
| global-search (map-reduce over communities) | 1 map + 1 reduce LLM call (~30s on the `ok` path); 0 ms / 0 LLM on no-data |
| hop (expand one node) | no embed/LLM — pure in-memory adjacency (fastest) |
| CLI total (Python startup + httpx) | +1.5s overhead |

`ask` is slower when it escalates to Phase-2 synthesis (an extra LLM call).
Embeddings are served by the configured remote endpoint (`KL_EMBED_*` env
vars); the embedding dimension is fixed at build time, so changing models
requires a full re-embed.

## Retrieval Patterns

> **Query strategy (read first).** Before running any `kl` command, think
> carefully about what the user is actually asking and which commands will
> answer it — plan the sequence, don't fire commands blindly. **Always start a
> search with `kl ask`** (hybrid retrieval + graph walk + optional synthesis);
> it is the primary entry point. **Avoid `kl search`** — it is a low-level
> single-collection vector ANN and should only be used for narrow, specific
> lookups when `kl ask` clearly can't serve the need.

> **Answering — show evidence, then conclude.** To make results trustworthy,
> first quote the **original text you got from `kl`** (the raw message/fact
> content, verified with `kl context` where possible), then give **your
> conclusion** drawn from it. Lead with the source evidence, follow with your
> synthesis — never present a conclusion without the underlying `kl` output it
> rests on.

> **Semantic mismatch — filter before you drill.** Embedding-based retrieval
> (`ask`, `search`) ranks by vector proximity, which measures **keyword
> overlap**, not **topical relevance**. A result about "session 超时" in a
> model-benchmarking conversation is *not* an obstacle to "session 打标" work,
> even though both contain "session" and "超时". Before spending `context` or
> `hop` calls on any hit, ask: *"Is this about the same topic the user asked
> about, or does it just share words?"* Discard the misses silently, do not
> summarize them as "evidence found but not relevant" — that wastes the
> reader's attention. If fewer than 3 hits survive the filter, **rephrase the
> query** with more specific terms (e.g. "session 打标 进度" instead of
> "session 打标 障碍 超时 模型 训练") and query again, rather than padding the
> answer with off-topic results.

### 1. Direct Answer (factual questions)

```bash
kl ask "who decided to use e2b for sandbox" -k 5 \
  --entity e2b --entity-type SYSTEM --fact-type DECISION --no-phase2
kl context <best_fact_id>                          # ground the answer in source
```

### 2. Entity Deep-Dive (about a person/project/system)

```bash
kl entity "周强"                    # id + "similar" (ENTITY_SIMILAR) + top facts (with fact_ids)
kl facts <entity_id>                 # all facts ABOUT it (fact_id + text)
kl context <fact_id>                 # ground a fact in its source message
kl community -l L2 --id <community_id>
kl members <community_id> -l L2 -t fact
kl timeline "周强" --from 2026-06-01
```

**Id-driven trace-back (no name round-trip):** every id `kl` prints is
traceable. `kl entity` returns an `entity_id` plus the facts about it; feed the
`entity_id` back with `kl entity --id <id>` (or `kl facts <entity_id>` for the
full list), then any `fact_id` to `kl context` for the exact source message
(or `kl facts --fact-id <id>` for just the fact text). The `similar` block also
shows each ENTITY_SIMILAR neighbor's name + full `entity_id`, so you can
`kl entity --id`/`kl facts` on those too. Prefer ids over names when chaining
— names aren't unique (e.g. two `周强` entities).

(To find a person/system when unsure of the exact surface form, use
`kl search "<term>" -c entities` for a semantic entity lookup.)

### 3. Broad Survey (exploratory)

```bash
kl search "sandbox architecture" -c communities -k 5  # Find relevant communities
kl members <community_id> -l L2 -t fact               # Read the facts
kl context <fact_id>                                   # Ground in source
```

Or browse linearly:

```bash
kl community -l L1 -t entity    # Team-level (best starting point)
kl community -l L2 --id 8       # Drill into a project
kl members 8 -l L2 -t entity    # Who's in it?
```

### 4. Alias Resolution

```bash
kl entity "张伟"
kl entity --id <entity_id>       # the "similar" block lists ENTITY_SIMILAR links
```

### 5. Timeline

```bash
kl timeline "InkFlow" --from 2026-06-01 --to 2026-07-01
```

### 6. Topic Discovery

```bash
kl community -l L1 -t fact      # What topics exist?
kl community -l L2 -t fact --id 5  # Detail on one
kl members 5 -l L2 -t fact         # Read facts
```

### 7. Interactive Graph Walk (relationship / multi-hop questions)

Use `ask` when the question is about *how things connect* (who works with whom,
what a decision depends on, how a system relates to a project). A single `ask`
call already returns both flat recall (`items`) **and** a hoppable subgraph
(`seeds`/`nodes`/`edges`/`expandable` + a `cursor`) — walked from the
entities/facts the query extracted. There is **no separate `graph` command**;
the walk is built into `ask`.

```bash
kl ask "e2b 部署平台和谁相关" --seed-k 6 --max-nodes 40   # items + seeds + hop-1 subgraph (JSON)
kl ask "e2b 部署平台和谁相关" --pretty                    # human view + expandable ids
```

The response includes `nodes`, `edges`, an `expandable` list of node ids, and a
`cursor` object. To go deeper, expand a specific node one hop with `hop`,
passing the `cursor` back so visited state and decay carry over:

```bash
# take an id from "expandable" and the "cursor" object from the ask response
kl hop -n "ent:<id>" -c '<cursor-json-from-previous-response>'
```

Notes:

- Node ids are namespaced: `ent:<entity_id>` and `fact:<fact_id>`.
- If the graph isn't built, `ask` falls back to `mode="chunks_only"` (flat
  vector hits) in the same response shape — check the `mode` field.
- `hop` does no embedding/LLM (pure in-memory walk) — cheap to chain.
- Ground any interesting fact node with `kl context <fact_id>` as usual.

### 8. Global Search (experimental, capability-gated)

Use this pattern only when `kl capabilities --json` reports
`commands.global-search.enabled=true`. Otherwise use `ask`, `facts`, and
`timeline`; do not call the disabled command.

Use `kl global-search` when the question is **conceptual and person-scoped** —
it must be *aggregated* over everything a person has been involved in, not
answered by any single chunk/fact. Canonical example: *"我最近的任务是什么"*
(what are my recent tasks?), *"这个人主要负责什么"* (what does this person mainly
work on?). Where `ask` does flat recall + a depth-1 graph walk, `global-search`
resolves the person to a Person entity, collects **that person's community
summaries across L0–L3**, and runs a GraphRAG-style **map-reduce** over them
(strict-JSON key points scored 0–100 → drop score-0 → importance-sort →
token-budgeted reduce → grounded markdown with `[Data: Communities (...)]`
citations).

```bash
kl global-search "我最近的任务是什么" --user "孙亮"   # explicit person
kl global-search "这个人主要负责什么"                    # identity via DWS get-self
kl global-search "我最近的任务是什么" --json            # full wire shape for chaining
```

Identity resolution precedence: **`--user <name>`** → **DWS `get-self`** (the
CLI shells out to `dws contact user get-self` for the logged-in user) →
otherwise the server's `KL_CURRENT_USER`. The response carries `reason`,
`communities` (the selected `{level, community_id, member_count}`), `citations`,
and `diagnostics` (map/reduce call counts, latency).

When there is **no grounding** — the name doesn't resolve
(`reason=identity_unresolved`), or the person has no community memberships
(`reason=no_communities`) — it returns a **canned bilingual no-data answer in
~0 ms with ZERO LLM calls** plus a remediation hint (e.g. run
`python -m scripts.improve`). It never falls back to a corpus-wide search or
errors out.

Requires the community layer to be built **and summarized**: `kl ingest` /
`scripts.improve` create the `community_L0..L3` columns, and
`python -m kl_graph.periodic.community_summarizer` generates the summaries this
command reads. Without summaries every query returns `no_communities`.

> **Caveat — summaries are name-based, not task-based (today).** Community
> summaries are built from member *names/aliases*, so a person whose graph
> neighborhood is dominated by identity/HR material may get a thin, honest
> "can't pin down concrete tasks" answer even on the `ok` path. That is a data
> limitation, not a retrieval bug — prefer `ask`/`facts`/`timeline` for
> specific, dateable task lookups, and use `global-search` for the high-level
> "what has this person been about" shape.

## Community Hierarchy

Drill-down pattern for navigating the graph:

```
L0 (org-level)       -> "Which team?"
L1 (team-level)      -> "Which project?"       <- BEST STARTING POINT
L2 (project-level)   -> "Which component?"
L3 (component-level) -> "Specific facts + evidence"
```

## Search Budget & Stop Criteria

### When to STOP drilling

- You have ≥3 grounded facts (with `kl context` verification) that **genuinely
  match the user's question** and answer it
- You've reached L3 community level (most granular — no further drill-down)
- Two consecutive queries returned no new **semantically relevant** information
- The user's question is answered with high confidence from existing results
- A query returns only keyword-overlap hits with no topically relevant result —
  **rephrase and retry once**; if still no match, report what you found rather
  than forcing off-topic evidence into the answer

### Rejection signals — do NOT drill into these

- The result shares keywords ("session", "超时", "模型") but discusses a
  different topic (benchmarking, billing, deployment) than what the user asked
- The surrounding context (`kl context`) reveals the conversation is about a
  different project or task than the question targets
- A fact's `subject_entity` or `object_entity` is unrelated to the question's
  domain — the connection is coincidental keyword overlap, not topical
  similarity
- A graph `hop` expands into entities/facts that are clearly off-topic from the
  seed — stop expanding that branch immediately

### Query budget per question

- Simple factual: 2-3 commands (ask → context → done)
- Entity deep-dive: 4-6 commands (entity → facts → context, or entity → community → members → timeline → context)
- Broad survey: 5-8 commands (community L1 → pick → L2 → members → context × 2-3)
- Relationship / multi-hop: ask (walks the graph) → hop (× 1-2 on expandable ids) → context
- Maximum: 10 commands per question before synthesizing what you have

### Confidence signals

- Fact type=DECISION with confidence≥0.9 → high reliability
- Multiple facts from different messages saying the same thing → confirmed
- Single fact from one message → report but flag as single-source
- Community summary matching your query with score≥0.8 → right neighborhood

## Key Notes

- Entity names are Chinese and English: "周强", "InkFlow", "VS Code"
- Fact IDs support prefix match: `kl context 49d8370a`
- High-degree entities (>200 edges) get auto-filtered to last 90 days on timeline (use --from/--to to override)
- Check `kl status` first — if server not running, use `kl start`
- Time range: 2025-09 to 2026-07
